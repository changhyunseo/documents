title: In and out
---

Instead of the `transition` directive, an element can have an `in` or an `out` directive, or both together. Import `fade` alongside `fly`...

```js
import { fade, fly } from 'svelte/transition';
```

...then replace the `transition` directive with separate `in` and `out` directives:

```html
<p in:fly="{{ y: 200, duration: 2000 }}" out:fade>
	Flies in, fades out
</p>
```

In this case, the transitions are *not* reversed.
